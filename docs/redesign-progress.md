## Confirmed Baseline

- Repository: `lelapinsauvage/KDDZ`.
- Local checkout: `/Users/karimsaab/Desktop/garderie`.
- Active redesign branch: `ux-redesign-awards`, created directly from verified `main` at `0359e26`.
- `main`, `legacy-parity-runbook`, `ux-redesign`, and their corresponding remote refs currently point to commit `0359e26`.
- The approved Remotion logo work and planning documents are preserved on the redesign branch.
- The rejected `src/app/design-lab/dashboard-cards/page.tsx` experiment was excluded from the redesign branch.
- Current product census: 244 page files, 83 route handlers, 113 React component files.
- The functional restoration parity matrix contains 1,713 rows and remains the preservation source.

### Foundation verification

- `pnpm exec eslint remotion --max-warnings=0`: passed.
- `pnpm exec next typegen`: passed.
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: passed after removing the stale generated `.next/dev` cache.
- Remotion composition `KiddzOnlineLogoIntro` rendered successfully at frame 115.

### Discovery evidence

- Eleven authenticated 1440 x 900 browser baselines are stored in `docs/redesign/baseline/`.
- `docs/redesign/flow-inventory.md` maps 244 page files into 22 canonical domains and seven critical end-to-end journeys.
- `docs/redesign/current-state-findings.md` records current strengths, risks, problem statements, and research questions.
- `src/scripts/report-redesign-parity-domains.ts` assigns all 1,713 parity rows to canonical redesign or platform domains with zero unmapped rows.
- The first confirmed runtime defects include dashboard horizontal overflow, colliding chart labels, unsafe all-present attendance defaults, ambiguous time context, and missing live ratio state.

## Locked Decisions

| Decision | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop is the primary design surface | Locked | User direction |
| The operational UI is approximately 90% white/near-white | Locked | User direction |
| Color must visually guide importance and action | Locked | User direction |
| The product must be expressive and unique, not generic SaaS | Locked | User direction and rejected prototypes |
| All restored functionality remains accessible | Locked | Product mission and parity matrix |
| No fake charts or unnecessary data visualization | Locked | User direction |
| No random decorative shapes, colored left borders, or filler | Locked | User direction and rejected prototypes |
| Motion should use purposeful springs, continuity, and morphs | Locked principle | User direction; final tokens pending research |
| Pinterest board is a living reference source | Locked | User-supplied board |
| Current approved logo intro is the identity baseline | Locked baseline | Completed Remotion iteration |

## Current Tooling Note

The Mobbin MCP is registered and enabled at `https://api.mobbin.com/mcp` with OAuth. Its tools were not exposed to the current Codex task after installation. A Codex restart or fresh task is required before direct Mobbin flow extraction. This does not block repository inventory, Pinterest review, official research, or planning.

## Next Work Queue

1. Capture authenticated teacher, manager, nurse, doctor, and parent runtime baselines.
2. Trace the seven critical journeys through mutations, errors, and recovery.
3. Capture compact desktop, tablet, and mobile current-state evidence.
4. Tag the Pinterest board using the master-plan taxonomy.
5. Complete Mobbin flow sheets for Revolut, Notion, Cosmos, Duolingo, Duolingo ABC, Genie, and Anything.
6. Refresh direct competitor flow research.
7. Write the benchmark synthesis and explicit product implications.
8. Draft the brand strategy and personality spectrum.
9. Build three complete creative territories using realistic product content.
10. Review the territories against the award and usability scorecards.

## Definition of a Completed Tracker Item

An item is complete only when:

- Its expected artifact exists.
- Sources or product evidence are linked.
- Acceptance criteria are checked.
- Browser evidence exists when the item affects UI or behavior.
- Functional parity implications are recorded.
- Open risks and assumptions are documented.
- Relevant tests pass.
- The change is committed in a reviewable increment when implementation has begun.

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Why | Reversible |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-07-10 | Use a research-gated redesign process before further page styling | Previous styling attempts lacked a shared visual language and did not change the UX | Yes |
| 2026-07-10 | Separate benchmark principles from visual copying | The product needs its own identity while learning from excellent systems | Yes |
| 2026-07-10 | Weight progress by verified deliverables | Percentage estimates previously became misleading | Yes |
| 2026-07-10 | Keep functional parity as a parallel acceptance track | A beautiful redesign cannot remove restored legacy behavior | No for removal; mapping is revisable |
| 2026-07-10 | Create `ux-redesign-awards` directly from verified `main` | All local and remote restoration/design refs shared the same base, and the new name separates accepted work from rejected experiments | Yes |
| 2026-07-10 | Preserve the approved Remotion identity work and exclude the dashboard card lab | The user approved the logo direction and explicitly rejected the dashboard experiment | Yes |

## Work Log

### 2026-07-10 - Phase 0 foundation

- **Question:** Can the redesign begin from a clean, auditable branch without losing approved identity work?
- **Evidence:** Local/remote branch refs, worktree diff, Remotion source, rejected design-lab route, TypeScript and ESLint output, rendered frame 115.
- **Decision:** Create `ux-redesign-awards` from `main`, preserve Remotion and plan files, exclude the rejected dashboard lab.
- **Verification:** Remotion ESLint passed; Next route types regenerated; TypeScript passed; Remotion still rendered successfully.
- **Open item:** Baseline screenshots and runtime flow capture are still required to close Phase 0.
- **Next action:** Start the current-product canonical flow inventory and browser baseline.
- **Progress earned:** 1 additional percentage point; total 3%.

### 2026-07-10 - Phase 1 current-state discovery

- **Question:** What are the real user workflows beneath the legacy route count, and where does the current experience create operational risk?
- **Evidence:** Authenticated browser runs at 1440 x 900 across dashboard, Today, branches, children, child dossier, daily reports, staff, medical, accounting, messaging, and settings; role navigation source; Prisma roles; route and parity inventories.
- **Decision:** Treat 22 domains as canonical redesign surfaces and prioritize seven cross-domain journeys instead of redesigning 244 pages independently.
- **Artifacts:** `docs/redesign/flow-inventory.md`, `docs/redesign/current-state-findings.md`, eleven baseline PNGs, and the generated parity-domain ledger.
- **Open items:** Role-specific sessions, mutation/error traces, responsive baselines, and parity-row linking.
- **Next action:** Build the reproducible domain-to-parity ledger, then continue role and responsive runtime discovery.
- **Progress earned:** 3 additional percentage points; total 6%.

## Blocker Policy

Do not stop for ordinary design uncertainty. Research it, document the assumption, and choose the strongest reversible option. Stop only when the next step would:

- Remove or materially change a product capability.
- Commit the brand to an unreviewed direction.
- Require production credentials, private evidence, or a real external transaction.
- Expose sensitive child, parent, staff, medical, or financial data.
- Make an irreversible repository or infrastructure change.
